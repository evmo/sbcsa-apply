## Next Steps

- Now that the **Team Leader** app is completed, we need individual **Team Member** applications from each relay member who will be swimming, and from any alternates.
- If you (the Team Leader) will be swimming, you also need to complete a Team Member app.
- Please provide your team members the link to the Team Member app - **[sbcsa.us/relay-member](https://sbcsa.us/relay-member)**.
- They will need to enter the **Team Name** to identify themselves as a member of your team. All other requested information is specific to the individual.
- The Relay Application is considered complete when all Team Member apps have been received.
