## Relay Team Leader Application

#### Thanks for your interest in a Santa Barbara Channel relay swim. We looking forward to working with you.

This application should be completed only once per relay, by the relay team leader.

The team leader must be 18 years or older. Relay swimmers can be younger than 18, but the team leader (who may or may not also be swimming) must be 18+.

All team members (including the team leader, if the team leader is also swimming) should also complete the Relay Member Application.

### Instructions

- For best results, we recommend using a standard desktop or laptop computer with a modern web browser such as Google Chrome. This application is not tested on mobile devices!
- The following pages will guide you through the information we need about you and your planned swim. Feel free to browse through the pages to preview the questions.
- Required fields are <span class="required">outlined in red</span>.
- <span class="red">Red text</span> at bottom of each page provides feedback about incomplete fields.
- Each page turns <span class="green">bold green</span> when all the required fields on that page are complete.
- Click the **Save and Return Later** page to save a partially-completed application that you will finish later.
- Please double-check your entries for accuracy. When you are ready, use the **SUBMIT** tab to send your application to the SBCSA.
