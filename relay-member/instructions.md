## Relay Member Application

#### Thanks for your interest in a Santa Barbara Channel relay swim. We looking forward to working with you.

- For best results, we recommend using a standard desktop or laptop computer with a modern web browser such as Google Chrome. This application is not tested on mobile devices!
- The following pages will guide you through the information we need about you and your planned swim. Feel free to browse through the pages to preview the questions.
- Required fields are <span class="required">outlined in red</span>.
- <span class="red">Red text</span> at bottom of each page provides feedback about incomplete fields.
- Each page turns <span class="green">bold green</span> when all the required fields on that page are complete.
- Click the **Save and Return Later** page to save a partially-completed application that you will finish later.
- Please double-check your entries for accuracy. When you are ready, use the **SUBMIT** tab to send your application to the SBCSA.
