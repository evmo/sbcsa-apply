In this section we would like to learn about your open water swimming experience - especially any documented marathon swims you have done.

Please search for your name in the <a href="https://longswims.com/" target="_blank">LongSwims Database</a>. **If you have a LongSwimsDB profile and feel it fairly represents your recent swimming achievements, please simply paste a link to your profile in the box below.**

Otherwise, please use the box to tell us more about your swimming background, training, and recent swims. Details might include:

- Recent organized swim events/races you have done (especially last 3 years).
- How far you swim each week, on average.
- Recent long training swims.
- Proportion of training you do in open water vs. the pool.
- Your local body of open water - typical water temps, how long you swim at these temps, etc.
- Your sustainable swimming pace (minutes/seconds per 100m for pool swimming, or minutes per statute mile for open water).

If you don't have any recent, documented marathon swims, the SBCSA may require you to complete a qualifying swim. The required distance depends on your planned route. For an Anacapa Channel swim or Anacapa circumnavigation, a typical qualifier would be a 10km ocean swim in 65F water temperature or cooler. The annual [Semana Nautica](https://semananautica.com) 6-mile Ocean Swim is also a valid qualifying swim for Anacapa.
